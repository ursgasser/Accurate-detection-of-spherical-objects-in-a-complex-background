# Accurate-detection-of-spherical-objects-in-a-complex-background

IDL code for the detection of spherical particles in 3d microscopy images.
This code was published in (see citation.bis) U. Gasser and B. Zhou, OpticsExpress, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.434652 (2021).

We plan to also give a python version.

The particle detection code is given in the files find_spheres_div.pro and find_spheres_y2.pro.
find_spheres_div.pro: B&gradient method in the paper given above.
find_spheres_y2.pro: B&Y method in the paper given above.
